################################   PEMA 's PARAMETERS   ####################################
############################################################################################
#
#    for version 2.1.3
#
# In this file there are all the parameters that need to be assigned every time PEMA is 
# about to run! The parameters we have here, are not the only parameters of the tools 
# invoked by PEMA. Hence, we encourage you the most to study the manual of each tool and 
# make them as good as possible for your specific experiment.
#
# ATTENTION!
# From each variable you have to leave EXACTLY ONE (1) TAB and then fill in the parameter. 
#

#
# Give in your each uniq experiment a NAME, so a single output file will be created for each of them 
#
outputFolderName	test_12S_swarm
#
#
# PEMA needs the names of the samples to be as in ENA format (e.g "ERR1021912") but 
# they are more like as the Illumina sequencer returned them (e.g "FdCor_1.fast.gz") 
# In order to change the names of your samples as they should be.
# Otherwise, you need to set the "EnaData" variable as 'No'.  
EnaData	Yes
#
#
# Each sequencer has a special combination of letters with which all its reads start with
# For example MiSeq has "@M0". Please provide this pattern to PEMA to convert your data to the ENA 
# format. If you do not know that, you can either google it or gunzip a fastq.gz files of yours and provide
# the letatters between the "@" and the first ":" characters.

#
# PANDAseq is the algorithm that PEMA uses in order to merge the paired-end reads.
# PANDAseq has more than one merging algorithms.
#
# Here, we set the algorithm used for assembly. The most common of them are:
# pear --> uses the formula described in the PEAR paper (Zhang 2013), optionally with the probability of a random base (q) provide
# simple_bayesian --> uses the formula described in the original paper (Masella 2012), optionally with an error estimation (ε) provided.
# other options are stich, flash and more that you can fing in the above link.
#
pandaseqAlgorithm	simple_bayesian
#
#
# PANDAseq is a I/O bound algorithm. That means that it needs severous time in order to handle the ipnut and output files
# while the process is quite fast. However, it does support multithreading and here you can set the number of threads it is going to use.
#
pandaseqThreads	8
#
#
# The 'minlen' parameter sets the minimum length for a sequence, after primers are removed. 
# By default, all sequences are kept. With this option, sequences shorter than desired can be discarded.
# In case you need to use this parameter, be sure you leave a tab after 'minlen' and set it like this: '-l 80'
# If you do not want to use this parameter, please remove everything after the 'minlen' 
#
pandaseqMinlen	
#
#
# The 'minoverlap' parameter sets the minimum overlap between forward and reverse reads. 
# By default, this is at least one nucleotide of overlap. 
# Raising this number does not generally increase the quality of the output as alignments with small overlaps tend to score poorly and are discarded anyway.
#
minoverlap	1
#
#
# The 'threshold' parameter sets the score, between zero and one, that a sequence must meet to be kept in the output. 
# Any alignments lower than this will be discarded as low quality. 
# Increasing this number will not necessarily prevent uncalled bases (Ns) from appearing in the final sequence. 
# It is also used as the threshold to match primers, if primers are supplied. The default value is 0.6.
#
threshold	0.6
#
#
# The '-N' parameter eliminates all sequences with uncalled nucleotides in the output. 
# Otherwise, during assembly, uncalled bases (Ns) from unpaired regions may be emitted.
# If you need -N to be on your analysis, please add '-N' after 'elimination'. Please make sure you leave a tab. 
# If you do not want the parameter to be on, please make sure there is nothing after the 'elimination' parameter.

##########################################################################################################
#
#
# If your marker gene is 16S, you can choose between 2 different approaches of taxonomy assignment (alignment & phylogenetic based)
# An alignment based taxonomy assignment - set as 'alignment' -  which is based on SILVA and CREST (version 3.0).
# However, you can also get a phylogenetic based assignment, by putting 'phylogeny' in this parameter. In that case, a reference tree we created is being used as well as the RAxML 
#
taxonomyAssignmentMethod	alignment
#
#
# I you choose phylogeny based taxonomy assignment, then you ll need to rum PaPaRa.
# Pleas fill in how many cores PaPaRa is able to use.
#
numberOfCoresForPapara	7
#
#
# When you use the alignment-based taxonomy assignment, then the LCAClassifier from the CREST algorithm, uses a Silva version for the assignment. 
# PEMA allows you to choose between the two last version of Silva. Hence, set the "silvaVersion" parameter either as 'silva_128' or as 'silva_132'
# depending on the version of your choice.
#
silvaVersion	silva_132
#
#
# As you may need a series of taxonomy assignment when you use the alignment-based method, please give another name in your 
# taxonomy output folder of the CREST algorithm, each time you are about to use it. 
# CREST creates an output folder every time and if a folder with the same already exists, it is going to abort the task!
# You need to set the value of this parameter in case of 16S/18S rRNA and ITS marker genes.

########     Here are some parameters needed with respect to clustering algorithms     ###############
##########################################################################################################
#
#
# For the case of the 16S and 18S rRNA marker genes, you can either get an OTU-table using the VSEARCH algorithm
# or you can get an ASV-table by taking advantage of the SWARM algorithm. 
# If your marker gene is  COI or ITS, you can choose between 2 different approaches of clustering. 
# Depending on which of them you choose you get either a robust output in a short time (Swarm) or a non-robust output (CROP) that requires quite much more time.
# Please fill in accroding to your marker gene and needs (write "Swarm" or "vsearch" or "CROP" after algo_).
#
clusteringAlgo	algo_Swarm
#
#
# In case of SWARM, the user needs to speeecify the value of "d" parameter,
# maximum number of differences allowed between two amplicons, meaning that two amplicons
# will be grouped if they hav e integer (or less) differences. This is swarm's most important
# parameter
#
d	12
#
#
# when using the option --fastidious (-f), define the minimum mass of a large ASV. 
# By default, an ASV with a mass of 3 or more is considered large. 
# Conversely, an ASV is small if it has a mass of less than 3, meaning that it is composed of either one amplicon of abundance 2, or two amplicons of abundance 1. 
# Any positive value greater than 1 can be specified. Using higher boundary values will speed up the second pass, but also reduce the taxonomical resolution of swarm
# results. Default mass of a large OTU is 3.
#
boundary	3
#
#
# You also need to set the number of threads that Swarm is able to use
#
swarmThreads	20
#
#
## SWARM tends to create a great numebr of ASVs, especially when d takes a low value. 
## Would you like to remove the singletons (ASVs that appear only once with abundance equal to 1) ?
#
removeOligotons	Yes
#
#
# CROP is able to run on multiple CPUs. As PEMA needs to update an environmental variable to do thi$
#
omp_num_threads	20
#
#
# PEMA invokes the UCHIME_DENOVO3 algorithm for the chimera removal in the case of the COI marker gene.
# This is a quite common algorithm for that step, but you still need to choose the minimum abundance skew value.
# By default this value is equal to 16. However, the only difference between UCHIME_DENOVO2 and 3 is that in the second version,
# the abskew value used to be equal to 2. So, be my guest and pick your value as I really have no clue about that.
# Probably, for environmental studies a low abskew is better, while in more specific studies a larger one would fit most.

# Since PEMA v.2.0 both Midori and Midori2 are supported. The second version of Midori includes more than
# 180.000 unique species and expands beyond Metazoa. However, the computational time needed increases to a

###########################################################################################################
# In case you would prefer to use a reference database of yours for the taxonomy step, PEMA will ask you for the 
# files necessary to train each of the two classifiers supported. You need to provide those in the directory called
# `local_ref_db` and depending on which classifier will train, the files have to be in a different format.
# More specifically, if you are working with COI, then PEMA uses thes RDPClassifier and you need to provide a taxonomy
# and a sequence file, as described here: https://john-quensen.com/tutorials/training-the-rdp-classifier/
# If you are working with 16S, 18S or ITS then PEMA uses the CREST classifier for the taxonomy step
# and you need to provide the corresponding two files as described at: https://github.com/lanzen/CREST
# (see after the Output section).
# As containers are lost when exit from one, you will have to train the classifier, every time you run a new PEMA container
# If you are about to use a custom ref db, set the following parameter as 'Yes'. Otherwise, it must be set as 'No'.

#
# If wish to use Phyloseq in order to analyse your returned data then set the following  parameter 'phyloseq' with 'Yes'.
# In order to do that, PEMA needs an MSA that it is returned by the MAFFT (v7.427) aligner and a phylogeny tree of the OTUs found which is built by the RAxML-ng algorithm.
# Please remember that in order to use phyloseq a "metadata.tsv" file is necessary to be part of your anaylis folder. 
#
phyloseq	No
#
#
# The phyloseq object can handle phylogenetic trees as well. PEMA uses RAxML-ng in order to build such trees.
# Do you want to create such a tree with your OTUs? In case you build this once, you can use it as many times as you want.
#
tree	Yes
#
# In case you are about to use the phyloseq option, then a phylogeny tree has to be built. Hence, PEMA invokes the RAxML-ng algorithm
# which is able to run in more than one threads. Please set the number of threads RAxML is able to use.
