      # step 1. build the container!
      # You can add any other sregistry push commands here, and specify a client
      # (and make sure your define the encrypted environment credentials in gitlab
      # to push to your storage locations of choice

     - mkdir -p build && cp *.sif build
     - mkdir -p build && cp Singularity* build

      # Step 2. Take a look at "artifacts" below and add the paths you want added
      # You can also add the entire build folder. You can also upload to storage
      # clients defined by sregistry, here are some examples
      # https://singularityhub.github.io/sregistry-cli/clients
      # Environment variables must be defined in CI encrypted secrets/settings
      # https://code.stanford.edu/help/ci/variables/README#variables).
      #- /bin/bash build.sh --uri collection/container --cli google-storage Singularity
      #- /bin/bash build.sh --uri collection/container --cli google-drive Singularity
      #- /bin/bash build.sh --uri collection/container --cli globus Singularity
      #- /bin/bash build.sh --uri collection/container --cli registry Singularity

  # This is where you can save job artifacts
  # https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pipelines/job_artifacts.html
  # You can specify the path to containers or the build folder to save.
  # Don't forget to save your recipes too!
